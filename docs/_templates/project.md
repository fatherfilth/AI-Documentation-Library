# {REQUIRED: Project Title}

---

## Overview

{REQUIRED: 3–5 sentences. What is this project? What does it do? What's the current state? A reader should understand the project from this section alone.}

---

## 1. Goals & Requirements

### 1.1 What I Set Out to Build

{REQUIRED: The original vision — what problem this solves, who it's for, what success looks like.}

### 1.2 Constraints

{REQUIRED: Budget, timeline, tech constraints, skill constraints, or other boundaries that shaped decisions.}

### 1.3 Success Criteria

{REQUIRED: How you'd know this project worked. Metrics, user feedback, personal satisfaction — whatever applies.}

---

## 2. Stack & Tools

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| {REQUIRED} | {REQUIRED} | {REQUIRED} |

{REQUIRED: Narrative explaining the stack selection. What alternatives were considered? What made you choose this combination?}

---

## 3. Build Phases

### Phase 1: {REQUIRED: Phase Name}

**Duration:** {REQUIRED}
**Goal:** {REQUIRED}

{REQUIRED: What happened in this phase. Key decisions, what worked, what broke. Include code snippets, configs, or commands that were important.}

**Outcome:** {REQUIRED: What this phase produced.}

{REQUIRED: Add more phases as needed. Each phase should represent a meaningful chunk of work — not every commit, but every significant shift in direction or milestone.}

## 6. Results

### 6.1 What Was Built

{REQUIRED: The actual output — screenshots, links, descriptions of the finished (or current) state.}

### 6.2 Against Success Criteria

{REQUIRED: How did the results compare to the success criteria from section 1.3?}

---

## 7. Retrospective

### 7.1 What Worked Well

{REQUIRED: Tools, patterns, decisions, or approaches that paid off.}

### 7.2 What I'd Do Differently

{REQUIRED: Honest reflection. Not just "mistakes" but things that were fine but could be better.}

### 7.3 Surprises

{REQUIRED: Things you didn't expect — good or bad. The stuff that's hardest to learn from anyone else's documentation.}

---

## 8. Open Questions & Next Steps

{REQUIRED: What's unresolved? What would you do next if you continued? What would you investigate?}

---

## References

{REQUIRED: Numbered references. Every tool, library, tutorial, or resource that influenced the build. No bare URLs.}

1. [{REQUIRED: Label}]({REQUIRED: URL}) — {REQUIRED: context}

---

## Appendix

### A. Key Configs & Commands

{REQUIRED: The most important configs, commands, or code snippets from the build. The stuff someone would need to reproduce or understand the project.}

### B. Related Documents

{List any related docs in this library — tools used, skills applied, agent patterns employed, etc.}
