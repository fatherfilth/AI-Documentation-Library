# Projects

Build journals documenting the end-to-end process of building specific products and projects.

Unlike other categories in this library (which document reusable knowledge about tools, skills, models, agents, or repos), **projects** are about the journey of building a specific thing — the decisions made, tools chosen, problems hit, pivots taken, and outcomes achieved.

## What belongs here

- Full build logs for products, apps, or systems you've built
- Architecture decisions and why they were made
- Tool/stack selection rationale for a specific project
- Timeline of iterations, pivots, and milestones
- Retrospectives — what worked, what didn't, what you'd do differently

## What doesn't belong here

- Generic tool reviews → `docs/tools/`
- Transferable techniques not tied to a specific project → `docs/skills/`
- Agent architecture patterns → `docs/agents/`

## Template

Project docs use `docs/_templates/project.md` — a build journal format with phases, decisions, and retrospective sections rather than the standard research article format.

The standard `topic.md` template may also be used when the project discussion is more investigative than narrative.
